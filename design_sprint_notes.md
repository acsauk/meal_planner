## Business Opportunity

* THERE ARE A FEW APPS OUT THERE - BUT NONE SEEM TO BE COMPLETE - missing calories used, or prices, or products are limited
* PEOPLE ON A BUDGET - USEFUL TO INCLUDE PRICES - MAYBE IMPORTED FROM 3RD PARTIES

* FITNESS TRACKING ELEMENT - NUTRITIONAL AND EXERCISE INTERACTION

* Add recipes from various sources
* Assign menus
* Generate shopping list
* Maybe add to an online shopping cart

* Barcode scanning to add items to inventory
* When you make a recipe items are subtracted from inventory
* Scan items out of inventory
* Highlight sale items
* Nutritional recommendations and likes
* Wastage management - based on expiry date
